# Simple Formula one Angular application for a Software Engineering presentation

This project shows all formula 1 drivers in 2021 and is used for an Angular presentation for my Software Engineering lecture. 

## Prerequisites

If you want to code together with my along the lecture you need the following things:

Get NodeJS and npm (Node Package Manager) https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install the Angular cli with `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Create a new project `ng formula-one`, switch to the your project path (e.g. `cd ./formula-one`) and start the server with `ng serve --open`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API

You can find the used API with this [link](http://demo8820151.mockable.io/drivers). I created this API so I can't garanty the accuracy of the data.

## Presentation

You can find my powerpoint slides here: [Powerpoint points](https://github.com/lordi-byte/EPortfolio-Angular/blob/master/Angular.pptx)
